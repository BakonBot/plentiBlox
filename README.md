# What's plentiBlox?
**plentiBlox** is a program which allows you to port over images to Roblox in the form of ***frames*** using the C# implementation of Roblox's place format by @CloneTrooper1019 which can be found [here](https://github.com/CloneTrooper1019/Roblox-File-Format). plentiBlox supports lossless, lossy and no compression

# ...But why?
Someone had to *eventually* do it, so here we are now.

# *Disclaimer*: 
The main purpose of plentiBlox is, as stated, above, **creating higher quality images** due to Roblox decals having an image size limit. The purpose of plentiBlox is **NOT** to **bypass moderation** or in any way break the **Roblox Terms of Use** or **Community Guidelines**
